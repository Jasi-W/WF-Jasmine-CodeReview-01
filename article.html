				<h1>NASA is trying to squash conspiracy theories about the space station leak</h1><br>
				
				<p>
					Wild theories of sabotage still persist two weeks after a mysterious pressure leak occurred on the International Space Station, 
					and the gossip has gotten so nonsensical that both NASA and Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, 
					are now trying to quell the rumors.
				</p><br>
								
				<p>
					In a joint statement released today, NASA and Roscosmos claim that the US space agency is working closely with Russia to figure out the cause of the leak. 
					The statement also notes that no information will be released until the Russian-led investigation is over, 
					despite rampant speculation in the Russian press that the leak was possibly caused by one of NASA’s astronauts in space.
				</p><br>
				
				<p>
					During a teleconference yesterday, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine and Roscosmos general director 
					Dmitry Rogozin “affirmed the necessity of further close interaction between NASA and Roscosmos technical teams 
					in identifying and eliminating cause of the leak, as well as continuation of normal ISS operations 
					and NASA’s ongoing support of the Roscosmos-led Soyuz investigation,” according to the statement. 
					“They acknowledged the entire crew is dedicated to the safe operation of the station and all docked spacecraft to ensure mission success.”
				</p><br>
				
				<p>
					NASA and Roscosmos first detected a drop in the space station’s pressure around 7PM ET on Wednesday, 
					August 29th, suspecting that there was a leak of some kind on the ISS. The air was escaping at such a slow rate, 
					though, that flight controllers opted not to wake the crew. The next day, the six astronauts on board the ISS traced the leak 
					to a small hole inside one of the two Russian Soyuz capsules docked to the space station — the vehicles used to bring crew to 
					and from Earth. This particular Soyuz has been at the ISS since June 8th, and the hole was found in one of the modules 
					that is jettisoned before the Soyuz enters Earth’s atmosphere during its descent. So the piece is not necessary for the entire trip back to the ground.
